#          been installed may cause removing a kernel image to fail.

# directory where uBoot images and scripts are found

# Override the load address when running mkimage on the kernel.
# OMAP such as Beagleboard and Pandaboard: Use 0x80008000
# Tegra such as Trimslice: Use 0x00008000
# IMX such as Efika mx51 smarttop: Use 0x90008000
# Kirkwood such as Dreamplug, Guruplug, Sheevaplug: Use 0x00008000
